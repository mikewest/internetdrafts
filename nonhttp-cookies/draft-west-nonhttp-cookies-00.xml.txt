                     draft-west-nonhttp-cookies-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6265 by defining a "NonHttp" attribute which
   ensures that a given cookie is available only to "non-HTTP" APIs.
   Yes, it is a little strange for "HTTP State Management" to support
   exclusively non-HTTP use cases, but the internet is a strange place.
   So it goes.

1.  Introduction

   Cookies violate the same-origin policy in well-understood ways,
   outlined in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 of [RFC6265].  For better or worse,
   developers rely on this behavior in a number of ways.  In particular,
   it is quite common for developers to use cookies as a cross-origin
   storage mechanism, allowing state to be shared across all origins in
   a given registrable domain.  A user who signs into
   "https://m.example.com/" might expect to also be signed into
   "https://www.example.com/", and vice-versa.  Servers can support this
   expectation by setting a cookie at the apex domain:
   "uid=1234567;Secure;Domain=example.com".  The cookie will be sent
   along with HTTP requests to both origins, and the user's state can be
   maintained.

   Often, though, the fact that a cookie is sent over the wire is an
   unindended side-effect.  Developers may simply desire the ability to
   easily share client-side state between related origins, and have
   pressed cookies into this service.

   For example, web analytics packages might use a user agent's
   "document.cookie" API to set first-party cookies on a client's site
   that retain a user's state.  This gives them the information they
   need to do analytics work, but has the very unfortunate side-effect
   of sending those cookies along with first-party HTTP requests to the
   client's server.  This has a substantially negative impact on request
   size (and therefore performance), but also has privacy implications,
   as these cookies are often sent in plaintext over the network.

Internet-Draft              Non-HTTP Cookies                   June 2017


   This document aims to reduce both impacts by allowing developers to
   specify specific cookies as "NonHttp".  These cookies cannot be
   modified via "Set-Cookie" HTTP response headers, nor will they be
   included in "Cookie" HTTP request headers.  They are only accessible
   via "non-HTTP" APIs.

1.1.  Examples

   Non-HTTP cookies are only accessible via "non-HTTP" APIs.  For
   example, a developer might use HTML's "document.cookie" to set a non-
   HTTP cookie as follows:

   document.cookie = "name=value; Secure; NonHttp";

   That cookie would be available via subsequent calls to
   "document.cookie", but will not be included in HTTP requests to the
   developer's server.

2.  Terminology and notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Recommendations

   This section describes extensions to [RFC6265] necessary to implement
   the "NonHttp" attribute.

   1.  Extend the "cookie-av" grammar in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC6265] as
       follows:



   cookie-av      = expires-av / max-age-av / domain-av /
                    path-av / secure-av / httponly-av /
                    nohttp-av / extension-av
   nohttp-av      = "NoHttp"

   2.  Add a section to Section 4.1.2 of [RFC6265] describing the
       semantics of the "NonHttp" attribute as follows:

       The "NonHttp" attribute limits the scope of the cookie to "non-
       HTTP" APIs.  That is, the attribute instructs the user agent to
       omit the cookie when constructing a "Cookie" header for an HTTP
       request.

Internet-Draft              Non-HTTP Cookies                   June 2017


       If both the "NonHttp" and "HttpOnly" attributes are present when
       setting a cookie, the cookie will be ignored, regardless of its
       delivery mechanism.

   3.  Alter the storage model defined in Section 5.3 of [RFC6265] as
       follows:

       1.  Add "no-http-flag" as a field to be stored on each cookie.

       2.  Insert the following two steps after the current step 10:

           1.  If the "cookie-attribute-list" contains an attribute with
               an "attribute-name" of "NoHttp", set the cookie's "no-
               http-flag" to "true".  Otherwise, set the cookie's "no-
               http-flag" to "false".

           2.  If the cookie was not received from a "non-HTTP" API, and
               the cookie's "no-http-flag" is "true", abort these steps
               and ignore the cookie entirely.

       3.  Insert the following step after the current step 11.2:

           1.  If the newly created cookie was not received from a "non-
               HTTP" API, and the "old-cookie"'s "no-http-flag" is
               "true", abort these steps and ignore the newly created
               cookie entirely.

   4.  Add a section to Section 5.2 of [RFC6265] describing the
       processing requirements for the "NonHttp" attribute as follows:

       If the "attribute-name" case-insensitively matches the string
       "NonHttp", the user agent MUST append an attribute to the
       "cookie-attribute-list" with an "attribute-name" of "NonHttp" and
       an empty "attribute-value".

   5.  Alter the "Cookie" header generation in Section 5.4 of [RFC6265]
       as follows:

       1.  Add the following requirement to the list of requirements in
           the current step 1:

           +  If the cookie's "no-http-flag" is "true", then exclude the
              cookie if the "cookie-string" is not being generated for a
              "non-HTTP" API (as defined by the user agent).

4.  Security and Privacy Considerations

4.1.  Cross-origin storage capabilities

   There's a risk that allowing developers to suppress cookies from HTTP
   requests might lead to increased usage of cookies as a cross-origin
   storage mechanism.  Given existing usage, however, the worst case
   seems to be an increase from a high number to a marginally higher
   number.

   Note, though, that the capabilities provided here can already be
   obtained through clever use of the "path" attribute to scope cookies
   down to paths that aren't frequently requested.  These cookies can be
   accessed through clever use of "<iframe>" elements and the
   "history.pushState" API.

   The flag introduced here makes that mechanism significantly simpler,
   but does not introduce fundamentally new capabilities.

4.2.  Fewer Cookies on the Wire

   Non-HTTP cookies are never sent directly by the user agent over the
   network, which reduces their exposure to both active and passive
   network attackers.  It seems reasonable to expect that adoption of
   the "NonHttp" attribute by popular analytics packages could result in
   a substantial reduction in the usefulness of those packages' cookies
   when attempting to correlate a given user's activities over time and
   across networks.

4.3.  Legacy Clients

   Clients that do not support the "NonHttp" flag will fall back to the
   existing behavior: cookies with the flag will be accepted via any
   delivery mechanism, and will continue to be sent out with matching
   HTTP requests.

   Developers can use this behavior to feature-detect support for the
   flag: sending "Set-Cookie: nonhttp-support=0; NonHttp" will allow
   server-side detection by parsing the "Cookie" header sent with
   requests, and client-side detection via code like
   "document.cookie.match('nonhttp-support=0')".

5.  Aesthetic Considerations

5.1.  Isn't 'DOMOnly' a better name?  Or 'NoHttp'?  Or 'Insert Bikeshed
      Here'?

   "DOMOnly" is probably a better fit for the practical implications of
   this API.  "DocumentCookieOnly" is even more clear.  This document
   runs with "NonHttp" to match RFC 6265's existing language around
   "non-HTTP" APIs, and to avoid arguments about software that handles
   cookies, but doesn't work with a DOM or any particular JavaScript
   interface.  Bikeshedding is, of course, welcome.
