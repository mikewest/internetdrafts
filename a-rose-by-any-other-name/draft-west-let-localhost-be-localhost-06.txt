                     Let 'localhost' be localhost.
                draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6761 with the goal of ensuring that
   "localhost" can be safely relied upon as a name for the local host's
   loopback interface.  To that end, stub resolvers are required to
   resolve localhost names to loopback addresses.  Recursive DNS servers
   are required to return "NXDOMAIN" when queried for localhost names,
   making non-conformant stub resolvers more likely to fail and produce
   problem reports that result in updates.

   Together, these requirements would allow applications and
   specifications to join regular users in drawing the common-sense
   conclusions that "localhost" means "localhost", and doesn't resolve
   to somewhere else on the network.

1.  Introduction

   The "127.0.0.0/8" IPv4 address block and "::1/128" IPv6 address block
   are reserved as loopback addresses.  Traffic to this block is assured
   to remain within a single host, and can not legitimately appear on
   any network anywhere.  This turns out to be a very useful property in
   a number of circumstances; useful enough to label explicitly and
   interoperably as "localhost".  [RFC1537] suggests that this special-

   use top-level domain name has been implicitly mapped to loopback
   addresses for decades at this point, and that [RFC6761]'s assertion
   that developers may "assume that IPv4 and IPv6 address queries for
   localhost names will always resolve to the respective IP loopback
   address" is well-founded.

   Unfortunately, the rest of that latter document's requirements
   undercut the assumption it suggests.  Client software is empowered to
   send localhost names to DNS servers, and resolvers are empowered to
   return unexpectedly non-loopback results.  This divide between theory
   and practice has a few impacts:

   First, the lack of confidence that "localhost" actually resolves to
   the loopback interface encourages application developers to hard-code
   IP addresses like "127.0.0.1" in order to obtain certainty regarding
   routing.  This causes problems in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6
   (see problem 8 in [I-D.ietf-sunset4-gapanalysis]).

   Second, HTTP user agents sometimes distinguish certain contexts as
   "secure"-enough to make certain features available.  Given the
   certainty that "127.0.0.1" cannot be maliciously manipulated or
   monitored, [SECURE-CONTEXTS] treats it as such a context.  Since
   "localhost" might not actually map to the loopback address, that
   document declines to give it the same treatment.  This exclusion has
   (rightly) surprised some developers, and exacerbates the risks of
   hard-coded IP addresses by giving developers positive encouragement
   to use an explicit loopback address rather than a localhost name.

   This document updates [RFC6761]'s recommendations regarding
   "localhost" by requiring that name resolution APIs and libraries
   themselves return a loopback address when queried for localhost
   names, bypassing lookup via recursive and authoritative DNS servers
   entirely.

   In addition, recursive and authoritative DNS servers are required to
   return "NXDOMAIN" for such queries.  This increases the likelihood
   that non-conformant stub resolvers will not go undetected.  Note that
   this does not have the result that such resolvers will fail safe--it
   just makes it more likely that they will be detected and fixed, since
   they will fail in the presence of conforming name servers.

   These changes are not sufficient to ensure that "localhost" can be
   assumed to actually refer to an address on the local machine.  This
   document therefore further requires that applications that wish to
   make that assumption handle the name "localhost" specially.

2.  Terminology and notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   IPv4 loopback addresses are registered in Table 4 of Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC6890] as "127.0.0.0/8".

   IPv6 loopback addresses are registered in Table 17 of Section 2.2.3
   of [RFC6890] as "::1/128".

   The domain "localhost.", and any names falling within ".localhost.",
   are known as "localhost names".

3.  The "localhost."  Special-Use Domain Name

   Localhost names are special in the following ways:

   1.  Users are free to use localhost names as they would any other
       domain names.  Users may assume that IPv4 and IPv6 address
       queries for localhost names will always resolve to the respective
       IP loopback address.

   2.  Application software MAY recognize localhost names as special, or
       MAY pass them to name resolution APIs as they would for other
       domain names.

       If application software wishes to make security decisions based
       upon the assumption that localhost names resolve to loopback
       addresses (e.g. if it wishes to ensure that a context meets the
       requirements laid out in [SECURE-CONTEXTS]), then it MUST
       directly translate localhost names to a loopback address, and
       MUST NOT rely upon name resolution APIs to do so.

       Application software MUST NOT use a searchlist to resolve a
       localhost name.  That is, even if DHCP's domain search option
       [RFC3397] is used to specify a searchlist of "example.com" for a
       given network, the name "localhost" will not be resolved as
       "localhost.example.com", and "subdomain.localhost" will not be
       resolved as "subdomain.localhost.example.com".

   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST recognize localhost names
       as special, and MUST always return an appropriate IP loopback
       address for IPv4 and IPv6 address queries and negative responses
       for all other query types.  Name resolution APIs MUST NOT send
       queries for localhost names to their configured recursive DNS
       server(s).

       As for application software, name resolution APIs and libraries
       MUST NOT use a searchlist to resolve a localhost name.

   4.  (Caching) recursive DNS servers MUST respond to queries for
       localhost names with NXDOMAIN.

   5.  Authoritative DNS servers MUST respond to queries for localhost
       names with NXDOMAIN.

   6.  DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that the effective RDATA for
       localhost names is defined by protocol specification and cannot
       be modified by local configuration.

   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register
       localhost names in the normal way to any person or entity.
       Localhost names are defined by protocol specification and fall
       outside the set of names available for allocation by registries/
       registrars.  Attempting to allocate a localhost name as if it
       were a normal DNS domain name will not work as desired, for
       reasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 above.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "localhost." registration in the
   registry of Special-Use Domain Names [RFC6761] to reference the
   domain name reservations considerations section of this document.

4.1.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

   This document requests that IANA update the "localhost." registration
   in the registry of Special-Use Domain Names [RFC6761] to reference
   the domain name reservation considerations defined in Section 3.

4.2.  DNSSEC

   (Ed note: The following options seem reasonable.  I personally prefer
   the latter, but could be convinced that the former is reasonable if
   that's the way the working group's concensus trends.)

4.2.1.  Option 1: Explicit delegation

   The ".localhost" TLD is already assigned to IANA, as per [RFC2606].
   This document requests that a DNSSEC insecure delegation (that is, a
   delegation with no DS records) be inserted into the root-zone,
   delegated to "blackhole-[12].iana.org".

   This request for an insecure delegation relies on the rationale
   spelled out in section 4 of [I-D.wkumari-dnsop-internal], which



West                      Expires March 4, 2018                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         let-localhost-be-localhost            August 2017


   discusses the DNSSEC considerations for the ".internal" TLD.  The
   same considerations apply to this document's discussion of localhost
   names.

4.2.2.  Option 2: Implicit failure

   The ".localhost" TLD is already assigned to IANA, as per [RFC2606],
   but does not have an entry in the DNSSEC root-zone.  This means that
   the root will return an NXDOMAIN response along with NSEC records
   constituting a secure denial of existence if queried.  That's
   consistent with the requirements to return NXDOMAIN that are laid out
   in Section 3.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Applications are encouraged to resolve localhost names themselves.

   Applications that attempt to use the local resolver to query
   "localhost" do not fail safely.  If an attacker sets up a malicious
   DNS server which returns a non-loopback address when queried for
   localhost names, such applications will connect to that remote server
   assuming it is local.  This risk drives the requirement that
   applications resolve localhost names themselves if they intend to
   make security decisions based on the assumption that localhost names
   resolve locally.

   There may be cases in which the target runtime environment can be
   safely assumed to do the right thing with localhost names.  In this
   case, the requirement that the application resolve localhost names on
   its own may be safe to ignore, but only if all the requirements under
   point 2 of Section 3 are known to be followed by the resolver that is
   known to be present in the target environment.

6.  Implementation Considerations

6.1.  Non-DNS usage of localhost names

   Some application software differentiates between the hostname
   "localhost" and the IP address "127.0.0.1".  MySQL, for example, uses
   a unix domain socket for the former, and a TCP connection to the
   loopback address for the latter.  The constraints on name resolution
   APIs above do not preclude this kind of differentiation.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 6761

   Section 3 updates the requirements in section 6.3 of [RFC6761] in a
   few substantive ways:

   1.  Application software and name resolution APIs and libraries are
       prohibited from using searchlists when resolving localhost names,
       and encouraged to bypass resolution APIs and libraries altogether
       if they intend to make security decisions based on the
       "localhost" name.

   2.  Name resolution APIs and libraries are required to resolve
       localhost names to loopback addresses, without sending the query
       on to caching DNS servers.

   3.  Caching and authoritative DNS servers are required to respond to
       resolution requests for localhost names with NXDOMAIN.
